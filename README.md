## How to Navigate this Project

- I used a custom hook to fetch justice and case data. Cases were then filtered by justice start and finish date, counted, then merged into an new array with tallied votes.

- Justice start date and vote count is charted with the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) in a [Chart.js](https://github.com/christopherbowers/supreme-court/blob/main/src/components/Chart.js) component with a loading state until date is complete.
- A `useEffect` hook is used to check for window resizing to create correctly size scatter plot.

- I created [responsive styles](https://github.com/christopherbowers/supreme-court/blob/main/src/index.css) with multiple breakpoints.
- DM Sans font files are stored in a [fonts directory](https://github.com/christopherbowers/supreme-court/tree/main/src/fonts) to reduce DNS requests.
